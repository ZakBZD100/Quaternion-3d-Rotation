## Introduction
This repository presents a comparative study of 3D rotation methods: classical matrix rotations and quaternion-based rotations. The project is part of a TIPE (Travail d'Initiative Personnelle Encadr√©e) by Zakariae El Bouzidi.

## Mathematical Context
- **Rotation matrices**: 3x3 orthogonal matrices representing 3D rotations
- **Quaternions (‚Ñç)**: Hypercomplex numbers providing a robust alternative for 3D rotations

## Objectives
- Demonstrate the mathematical and computational advantages of quaternions for 3D rotations
- Provide a complete, tested implementation for both methods
- Serve as a reference for academic and engineering studies

## Performance Results
The project benchmarks both methods:
- **Matrix rotations**: 90 multiplications, 60 additions per rotation
- **Quaternions**: 48 multiplications, 24 additions per rotation

Performance graphs and detailed analysis are available in the [notebook](notebooks/quaternion_analysis.ipynb) and the [PDF report](docs/Quaternion_TIPE_2024.pdf).

## Repository Structure
- `src/` : Python modules for matrix and quaternion rotations, and performance comparison
- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebook for demonstrations and analysis
- `tests/` : Unit tests for all rotation methods
- `docs/` : Project documentation and the full TIPE PDF
